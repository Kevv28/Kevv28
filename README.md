##  About Me

Hi, I’m **Kevil Rana** — an SDE with a strong focus on **AI/ML systems and backend engineering**.

I enjoy taking messy real-world problems and turning them into **reliable, scalable software** — whether that’s:
- deploying ML pipelines,
- building FastAPI / Node.js backends,
- or integrating LLMs into real products.

I care about **clean architecture, performance, and real impact**, not just fancy buzzwords.
